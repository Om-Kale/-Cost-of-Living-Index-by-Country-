# 🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Power BI Project! 🚀

I've just wrapped up an insightful project where I analyzed the **Cost of Living Index by Country** using Power BI. 📊 This journey has been a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into data visualization and storytelling.

## Here’s what I explored:

- 📈 **Comparative Analysis**: Visualized the Cost of Living Index, Rent Index, Groceries Index, and more to highlight key differences across countries.
- 🗺️ **Interactive Dashboards**: Created dynamic visuals that allow users to explore data by country, making it easy to identify trends and insights at a glance.
- 🔍 **Key Insights**: Discovered interesting correlations between rent prices and overall living costs, and how local purchasing power varies worldwide.

I’m thrilled with how it turned out and would love to hear your thoughts! 💬

📌 Check out the dashboard screenshot below, and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss data analytics, Power BI, or anything in between!
